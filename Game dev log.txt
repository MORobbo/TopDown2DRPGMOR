Splicing sprites & adding a tilemap -

Learnt How to slice a sprite and format it correctly using the Inspector window 
When using pixelated graphics in a 2D Game ; set Filter mode to Point(No filter) and compression to none
This ensures that it looks crisp.

When splicing a sprite you have to select the relevant sprite mode. If it is a single sprite within the file you select single, multiple for more then one
I have used to sprite editor to splice the sprites. It is in one of the windows at the top. 

I then created a 2D Tilemap - Right click the hierarchy window, 2D Object, Tilemap, rectangular. 
Then set the grid to 0.16x0.16 - which is relevant to the tiles I was using.
I then created a tile pallet - Window, 2D, Tile Pallet
I created a seperate file for the tiles so that when I put them in the tile pallet the file I was using for my sprites was not cluttered. 
To add the sprites to the tile pallet, you have to drag and drop them into it.
You can then select the sprite you want to use and paint it upon the scene. 
To place tiles ontop of of the tilemap you have to create a new tilemap and put it a layer above the original.
